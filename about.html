        <h1>About us</h1>
        <p>Our video game, developed in Unity, was an exciting and educational challenge. With no prior experience in the software, we learned to handle various functions and attributes, from finding sprites to implementing animations and behaviors.

            We found a sprite pack called "Warped City" by ansimuz, which provided us with the essential elements for the game. During development, we overcame technical issues such as value management, bullet animations, and handling layers in 3D.
            
            This project has improved our skills in design, programming, and problem-solving, preparing us for future challenges in video game development.</p>
